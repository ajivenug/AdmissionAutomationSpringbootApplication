# AdmissionAutomationSpringbootApplication

This is a springboot application which automates an admission process using camunda 8. 
Here we are using camunda SaaS cluster to deploy and execute BPMN diagrams. 
Also we use camunda forms for usertask implementation. 
Here I have used ServiceTask, Usertask, Eventbased gateway, IntermediateMessageCatchEvent, TimerEvent, ErrorBoundryEvent, Multi Instance Marker, Parallel Gateway etc.
